melody_revised
==============

A tuned version of an arduino script called Melody. See http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Melody

The major difference here is that I've tuned the values for each individual note.

Also see https://gist.github.com/ianklatzco/9127560, which contains the chest noise from the Legend of Zelda.
